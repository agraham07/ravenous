# Ravenous

Ravenous is a React based portfolio project from Codecademy. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and Javascript to interact with the Yelp API and return search results based on sorting, location, and business name and/or description parameters. This project was a good and thorough starting point to instill confidence and to bring together the knowledge learned so far. In the future I want to completely redo the styling of the website to something more fun and unique as I continue to grow and sharpen my skills.

## Install and Test

- Dowload the Repository
- Open the project folder in your terminal
- Use npm run start to launch the server in your browser
- Test functionality using the three sorting options as well as different categories and locations
